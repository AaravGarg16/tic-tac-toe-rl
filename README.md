# Tic Tac Toe RL

A full-stack Tic Tac Toe game enhanced with reinforcement learning.

Tech Stack: React | FastAPI | PyTorch | TensorFlow

Features:

AI opponents powered by reinforcement learning, adapting to your play style.

Implements multiple RL algorithms:

1. Q-Learning – classic table-based learning

2. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) – neural network approach for complex strategies

3. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) – probabilistic planning for optimal moves

Dynamic difficulty scaling: easy → medium → hard based on AI algorithm choice.
