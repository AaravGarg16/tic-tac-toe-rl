# Tic Tac Toe RL

A full-stack Tic Tac Toe game enhanced with reinforcement learning.
Tech Stack: React | FastAPI | PyTorch | TensorFlow

Features:

○ AI opponents powered by reinforcement learning, adapting to your play style.

○ Implements multiple RL algorithms:

  1. Q-Learning – classic table-based learning
  2. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) – neural network approach for complex strategies
  3. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) – probabilistic planning for optimal moves

○ Dynamic difficulty scaling: easy → medium → hard based on AI algorithm choice.
